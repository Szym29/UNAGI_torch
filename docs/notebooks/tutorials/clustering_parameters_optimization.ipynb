    "# Hyper-parameters for clustering parameters optimization (CPO)\n",
    "\n",
    "UNAGI has a built-in clustering parameters optimization strategy to maintain consistency in cluster numbers and sizes, as well as the distances between cell neighbors, across various time-points. The improper number of neighbors in the neighborhood graph or the improper resolution setting can lead to over-clustering or underclustering, introducing complications in the analysis process. The consistency in the number and size of clusters is important for tracing the lineage of cell populations through various time-points of development or disease progression. The proposed CPO method encompasses two primary steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "-   Searching for the optimal number of neighbors to construct graphs with consistent cellneighbor distances across different time-points. Starting by selecting an anchor stage, which is the stage with a cell count closest to the median count of all time-points, denoted as $N_{anchor}$. Then the average distance between cells is caculated and their neighbors in this anchor stage are identified to establish the `anchor neighbor distance`. The goal for other time-points is to find a number of neighbors that yields a neighbor distance similar to that of the anchor stage. Noted that the number of neighbors should be within the pre-defined range $[N_{min}, N_{max}]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Determining the optimal clustering resolution. A resolution range $[R_{min},R_{max}]$ should be predefined for different time-points. CPO strategy will find a set of resolutions within the predefined range to have a similar median number of cells per cluster across time-points.\n",
    "\n",
    "By employing the CPO method, UNAGI ensures that the neighborhood graphs for different stages maintain similar cell-neighbor distances. Additionally, this approach ensures a consistent number and size of clusters across different stages, thereby enhancing the coherence and robustness of our analytical framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can specify hyper-parameters described above using the function `UNAGI().run_UNAGI`. The parameter `CPO_parameters` should be a **dictionary**:\n",

    "-   anchor_neighbors: $N_{anchor}$\n",
    "-   max_neighbors: $N_{max}$\n",
    "-   min_neighbors: $N_{min}$\n",
    "-   resolution_min: $R_{min}$\n",
    "-   resolution_max: $R_{max}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The larger number of neighbors will lead to a more sparse cell neighbors graph and potentially lead to larger clusters. On the other hand, the smaller number of neighbors will have a more condensed cell neighbor graphs which could lead to smaller clusters. For the resolution, typically increasing the resolution will lead to more clusters.\n",
